The noise scattering at a compressor inlet and outlet
==================================================

 In this example we extract the scattering of noise at a compressor inlet and outlet. In addition to measuring the
 pressure with flush-mounted microphones, we will use the temperature, and flow velocity that was acquired during the
 measurement. The data comes from a study performed at the
 `Competence Center of Gas Exchange (CCGEx) <https://www.ccgex.kth.se/>`_\.

1. Initialization
-----------------
First, we import the packages needed for this example.


.. code-block:: default

    import numpy
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import acdecom







The compressor intake and outlet have a circular cross section of the radius 0.026 m and 0.028 m.
The highest frequency of interest is 3200 Hz.


.. code-block:: default

    section = "circular"
    radius_intake = 0.026  # m
    radius_outlet = 0.028  # m
    f_max = 3200  # Hz







During the test, test ducts were mounted to the intake and outlet. Those ducts were equipped with three microphones
each. The first microphone had a distance to the intake of 0.73 m and 1.17 m to the outlet.


.. code-block:: default

    distance_intake = 0.073  # m
    distance_outlet = 1.17  # m







To analyze the measurement data, we create objects for the intake and the outlet test pipes.


.. code-block:: default

    td_intake = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(radius_intake,), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="kirchoff",
                                  distance=distance_intake, flip_flow=True)
    td_outlet = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(radius_outlet,), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="kirchoff",
                                  distance=distance_outlet)







.. note::
  The standard flow direction is in :math:`P_+` direction. Therefore, on the intake side, the Mach-number must be
  either set negative or the argument *flipFlow* must be set to *True*.

2. Sensor Positions
-------------------
We define lists with microphone positions at the intake and outlet and assign them to the *WaveGuides*.


.. code-block:: default


    z_intake = [0, 0.043, 0.324]  # m
    r_intake = [radius_intake, radius_intake, radius_intake]  # m
    phi_intake = [0, 180, 0]  # deg

    z_outlet = [0, 0.054, 0.284]  # m
    r_outlet = [radius_outlet, radius_outlet, radius_outlet]  # m
    phi_outlet = [0, 180, 0] #  deg

    td_intake.set_microphone_positions(z_intake, r_intake, phi_intake, cylindrical_coordinates=True)
    td_outlet.set_microphone_positions(z_outlet, r_outlet, phi_outlet, cylindrical_coordinates=True)








3. Decomposition
----------------
Next, we read the measurement data. The measurement must be pre-processed in a format that is understood by the
*WaveGuide* object. This is generally a numpy.ndArray, wherein the columns contain the measurement data, such
as the measured frequency, the pressure values for that frequency, the bulk Mach-number, and the temperature.
The rows can be different frequencies or different sound excitations (cases). In this example the
measurement was post-processed into a .txt file and can be loaded with the
`numpy.loadtxt <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html>`_ function.

.. note::
  The pressure used for the decomposition must be pre-processed, for example to account for microphone calibration.


.. code-block:: default


    pressure = numpy.loadtxt("data/turbo.txt",dtype=complex, delimiter=",", skiprows=1)








We review the file's header to understand how the data is stored in our input file.


.. code-block:: default

    with open("data/turbo.txt") as pressure_file:
        print(pressure_file.readline().split(","))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    ['# Mach-Number Intake', 'Mach-Number Outlet', 'temperature Intake', 'temperature Outlet', 'f', 'Mic1', 'Mic2', 'Mic3', 'Mic4', 'Mic5', 'Mic6', 'case\n']




The Mach-numbers at the intake and outlet are stored in columns 0 and 1, the temperatures in columns 2 and 3,
and the frequency in column 4. The intake microphones (1, 2, and 3) are in columns 5, 6, and 7. The outlet
microphones (3, 5, and 6) are in columns 8, 9, and 10. The case number is in the last column.


.. code-block:: default


    Machnumber_intake = 0
    Machnumber_outlet= 1
    temperature_intake = 2
    temperature_outlet = 3
    f = 4
    mics_intake = [5, 6, 7]
    mics_outlet = [8, 9, 10]
    case = -1








Next, we decompose the sound-fields into the propagating modes. We decompose the sound-fields on the intake
and outlet side of the duct, using the two *WaveGuide* objects defined earlier.


.. code-block:: default


    decomp_intake, headers_intake = td_intake.decompose(pressure, f, mics_intake,  temperature_col=temperature_intake,
                                                        case_col=case, Mach_col=Machnumber_intake)

    decomp_outlet, headers_outlet = td_outlet.decompose(pressure, f, mics_outlet,  temperature_col=temperature_outlet,
                                                        case_col=case, Mach_col=Machnumber_outlet)







.. note ::
  The decomposition may show warnings for ill-conditioned modal matrices. This typically happens for frequencies close
  to the cut-on of a mode. However, it can also indicate that the microphone array is unable to separate the
  modes. The condition number of the wave decomposition is stored in the data returned by
  :meth:`.WaveGuide.decompose` and should be checked in case a warning is triggered.

4. Further Post-processing
--------------------------

We can print the *headersDS* to see the names of the columns of the arrays that store the decomposed sound fields.



.. code-block:: default

    print(headers_intake)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    ['(0,0) plus Direction', '(0,0) minus Direction', 'f', 'Mach_number', 'temperature', 'Ps', 'condition number', 'case']




We use that information to extract the modal data.


.. code-block:: default

    minusmodes = [1]  # from headers_intake
    plusmodes = [0]








Furthermore, we acquire the unique decomposed frequency points.


.. code-block:: default

    frequs = numpy.abs(numpy.unique(decomp_intake[:, headers_intake.index("f")]))
    nof = frequs.shape[0]








For each of the frequencies, we can compute the scattering matrix by solving a linear system of equations
:math:`S = p_+ p_-^{-1}`\, where :math:`S` is the scattering matrix and  :math:`p_{\pm}` are matrices containing the
acoustic modes placed in rows and the different test cases placed in columns.

.. note::
  Details for the computation of the Scattering Matrix and the procedure to measure the different test-cases can be
  found in `this study <https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2016/00000102/00000005/art00008>`_\.



.. code-block:: default

    S = numpy.zeros((2,2,nof),dtype = complex)

    for fIndx, f in enumerate(frequs):
        frequ_rows = numpy.where(decomp_intake[:, headers_intake.index("f")] == f)
        ppm_intake = decomp_intake[frequ_rows]
        ppm_outlet = decomp_outlet[frequ_rows]
        pp = numpy.concatenate((ppm_intake[:,plusmodes].T, ppm_outlet[:,plusmodes].T))
        pm = numpy.concatenate((ppm_intake[:,minusmodes].T, ppm_outlet[:,minusmodes].T))
        S[:,:,fIndx] = numpy.dot(pp,numpy.linalg.pinv(pm))








5. Plot
-------
Finally, we can plot the transmission and reflection coefficients at the intake and outlet.


.. code-block:: default


    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[0, 0, :]), ls="-", color="#67A3C1", label="Reflection Intake")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[0, 1, :]), ls="--", color="#67A3C1", label="Transmission Intake")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[1, 1, :]), ls="-", color="#D38D7B", label="Reflection Outlet")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[1 ,0, :]), ls="--", color="#D38D7B", label="Transmission Outlet")
    plt.xlabel("Frequency [Hz]")
    plt.ylabel("Scattering Magnitude")
    plt.xlim([300,3200])
    plt.ylim([0,1.1])
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

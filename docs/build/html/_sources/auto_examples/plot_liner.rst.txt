The transmission loss (TL) along a duct liner
==================================================

In this example we compute the transmission-loss of a duct liner with grazing flow (M=0.25). The data used in this
example was part of `this study <https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2020-2615>`_\,
which is referred to here for further details.

1. Initialization
-----------------
First, we import the packages needed for this example.


.. code-block:: default

    import numpy
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import acdecom







The liner is mounted along a duct with a rectangular cross section of the dimensions (0.02 m x 0.11 m).
The highest frequency of interest is 1000 Hz. The bulk Mach-number is 0.25 and the temperature is 295 Kelvin.


.. code-block:: default

    section = "rectangular"
    a = 0.02  # m
    b = 0.11  # m
    f_max = 1500  # Hz
    M = 0.25
    t = 295  # Kelvin







Test-ducts were mounted to the downstream and upstream side of the liner. Those ducts were equipped with
three microphones, each. The first microphone on each side had a distance of 0.21 m to the liner.


.. code-block:: default

    distance_upstream = 0.21  # m
    distance_downstream = 0.21  # m







To analyze the measurement data, we create :class:`.WaveGuide` objects for the upstream and the downstream test ducts.


.. code-block:: default

    td_upstream = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(a, b), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="stinson",
                                    distance=distance_upstream, M=M, temperature=t, flip_flow=True)
    td_downstream = acdecom.WaveGuide(dimensions=(a, b), cross_section=section, f_max=f_max, damping="stinson",
                                      distance=distance_downstream, M=M, temperature=t)







.. note::
  The standard flow direction is in :math:`P_+` direction. Therefore, on the inlet side, the Mach-number must be
  either set negative or the argument *flipFlow* must be set to *True*.

.. note::
  We use `Stinson's <https://asa.scitation.org/doi/10.1121/1.400379>`_ model for acoustic dissipation along the pipe.
  This is more accurate than the model by Kirchoff (which is commonly used). However, it is computationally more
  expensive.

2. Sensor Positions
-------------------
We define lists with microphone positions at the upstream and downstream side and assign them to the *WaveGuides*.


.. code-block:: default


    z_downstream = [0, 0.055, 0.248] # m
    x_downstream = [a/2, a/2, a/2]  # deg
    y_downstream = [0, 0, 0]   # m

    z_upstream = [0.249, 0.059, 0]    # m
    x_upstream = [a/2, a/2, a/2]  # deg
    y_upstream = [0, 0, 0]  # m

    td_upstream.set_microphone_positions(z_upstream, x_upstream, y_upstream)
    td_downstream.set_microphone_positions(z_downstream, x_downstream, y_downstream)








3. Decomposition
----------------
 Next, we read the measurement data. The measurement must be pre-processed in a format that is understood by the
 :class:`.WaveGuide` object. Generally, this is a numpy.ndarray, wherein the columns contain the measurement data,
 such as the measured frequency and the pressures at the microphone locations. The rows can be different frequencies
 or different sound excitations (cases). In this example, the measurement was post-processed into a .txt file and can
 be loaded with the `numpy.loadtxt <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html>`_ function.

.. note::
  The pressure used for the decomposition must be pre-processed, fo example to account for microphone calibration if
  necessary.



.. code-block:: default

    pressure = numpy.loadtxt("data/liner.txt", dtype=complex, delimiter=",", skiprows=1)







We examine the file's header to understand how the data is stored in our input file.


.. code-block:: default

    with open("data/liner.txt") as pressurefile:
        print(pressurefile.readline().split(","))




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    ['# Mach-Number upstream', 'Mach-Number downstream', 'temperature upstream', 'temperature downstream', 'f', 'Mic1 US', 'Mic2 US', 'Mic3 US', 'Mic1 Liner', 'Mic2 Liner', 'Mic3 Liner', 'Mic4 Liner', 'Mic5 Liner', 'Mic6 Liner', 'Mic7 Liner', 'Mic8 Liner', 'Mic9 Liner', 'Mic10 Liner', 'Mic1 DS', 'Mic2 DS', 'Mic3 DS', 'case\n']




The upstream microphones (1, 2, and 3) are in columns 5, 6, and 7. The Downstream microphones
(3, 5, and 6) are in columns 8, 9, and 10. The case number is in the last column. All the other columns contain
information that we do not need in this example.


.. code-block:: default


    f = 4
    mics_ds = [18, 19, 20]
    mics_us = [5, 6, 7]
    case = -1








Next, we decompose the sound fields into the propagating modes. We decompose the sound fields on the upstream
and downstream side of the duct, using the two *WaveGuide* objects defined earlier.


.. code-block:: default


    decomp_us, headers_us = td_upstream.decompose(pressure, f, mics_us, case_col=case)

    decomp_ds, headers_ds = td_downstream.decompose(pressure, f, mics_ds, case_col=case)








.. note ::
  The decomposition may show warnings for ill-conditioned modal matrices. This typically happens for frequencies close
  to the cut-on of a mode. However, it can also indicate, that the microphone array is unable to separate the
  modes. The condition number of the wave decomposition is stored in the data returned by
  :meth:`.WaveGuide.decompose` and should be checked in case a warning is triggered.

4. Further Post-processing
--------------------------
We can print the *headersDS* to see the names of the columns of the arrays that store the decomposed sound fields.



.. code-block:: default

    print(headers_us)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    ['(0,0) plus Direction', '(0,0) minus Direction', 'f', 'Mach_number', 'temperature', 'Ps', 'condition number', 'case']




We use that information to extract the modal data.


.. code-block:: default

    minusmodes = [1]  # from headers_us
    plusmodes = [0]







Furthermore, we can get the unique decomposed frequency points.


.. code-block:: default

    frequs = numpy.abs(numpy.unique(decomp_us[:, headers_us.index("f")]))
    nof = frequs.shape[0]








For each of the frequencies, we can compute the scattering matrix by solving a linear system of equations
:math:`S = p_+ p_-^{-1}`, where :math:`S` is the scattering matrix and  :math:`p_{\pm}` are matrices containing the
acoustic modes placed in rows and the different test cases placed in columns.

.. note::
  Details for the computation of the Scattering Matrix and the procedure to measure the different test-cases can be
  found in `this study <https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/dav/aaua/2016/00000102/00000005/art00008>`_\.



.. code-block:: default

    S = numpy.zeros((2,2,nof),dtype = complex)

    for fIndx, f in enumerate(frequs):
        frequ_rows = numpy.where(decomp_us[:, headers_us.index("f")] == f)
        ppm_us = decomp_us[frequ_rows]
        ppm_ds = decomp_ds[frequ_rows]
        pp = numpy.concatenate((ppm_us[:,plusmodes].T, ppm_ds[:,plusmodes].T))
        pm = numpy.concatenate((ppm_us[:,minusmodes].T, ppm_ds[:,minusmodes].T))
        S[:,:,fIndx] = numpy.dot(pp, numpy.linalg.pinv(pm))








5. Plot
-------
We can plot the transmission and reflection coefficients at the upstream and downstream sides.


.. code-block:: default


    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[0, 0, :]), ls="-", color="#67A3C1", label="Reflection Upstream")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[1, 0, :]), ls="--", color="#67A3C1", label="Transmission Upstream")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[1, 1, :]), ls="-", color="#D38D7B", label="Reflection Downstream")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(S[0, 1, :]), ls="--", color="#D38D7B", label="Transmission Downstream")
    plt.xlabel("Frequency [Hz]")
    plt.ylabel("Scattering Magnitude")
    plt.xlim([100,1600])
    #plt.ylim([0,1.1])
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()




.. image:: /auto_examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_liner_001.png
    :alt: plot liner
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





From the scattering matrix, we can compute the transmission loss and the power dissipation of the liner.


.. code-block:: default

    TLUpstream = -10* numpy.log10(numpy.abs(S[1, 0, :]))
    TLDownstream = -10* numpy.log10(numpy.abs(S[0, 1, :]))

    dissipation_us = -10* numpy.log10(numpy.sqrt(numpy.square(S[1, 0, :])+numpy.square(S[0, 0, :])))
    dissipation_ds = -10* numpy.log10(numpy.sqrt(numpy.square(S[0, 1, :])+numpy.square(S[1, 1, :])))

    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(TLUpstream), ls="-", color="#67A3C1", label="Transmission Loss (US)")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(dissipation_us), ls="--", color="#67A3C1", label="Dissipation (US)")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(TLDownstream), ls="-", color="#D38D7B", label="Transmission Loss (DS)")
    plt.plot(frequs, numpy.abs(dissipation_ds), ls="--", color="#D38D7B", label="Dissipation (DS)")
    plt.xlabel("Frequency [Hz]")
    plt.ylabel("Liner Performance [dB]")
    plt.xlim([100,1600])
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()
